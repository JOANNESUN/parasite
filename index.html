        <h2>European Paper Wasp</h2>
        <p>The European paper wasp, Polistes dominula, is one of the most common species of social wasp.</p>
        <h2>Strepsiptera</h2>
        <p>
            The Strepsiptera is a group of tiny insects that parasitize other insects; often bees or wasps. One of them, Xenos vesparum, uses the European paper wasp as a host. 
            The 600 or so species of strepsiptera are some of the cleverest, most brutal parasites on Earth. Unlike a lot of parasites out there, they have no interest in keeping their host alive for very long: They use them, abuse them, and explode out of their bodies, leaving gaping wounds that haven’t the slightest chance of healing.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Male strepsiptera</h3>
        <img src="parasite01.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="parasite fucking"/>
        <img src="male strepsiptera01.jpg" width="300" height="200"   alt="male strepsiptera "/>
        <p>
            Males look like you’d expect, with wings and antennae and mandibles and big, beautiful eyes.
        </p>
        <h3>Female strepsiptera</h3>
        <img src="female_strepsiptera01.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="female strepsiptera" />
        <img src="female_strepsiptera02.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="female strepsiptera" />
        <p>
         Female has nothing—no eyes, no antennae. It has no mouth parts. It’s nothing, the female is like a bag of eggs. 
         <br />She spends almost her entire life in the host, so what good would things like limbs do? Accordingly, she’s evolved into what is essentially just an oval of flesh.
         Importantly, though, the one thing she does have are naughty bits: the oviduct. This she sticks out of the hole in her host’s exoskeleton and emits a pheromone, and the males come running. They’ll inseminate her right there on the host.
